## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-27

### Analysis robustness (from a 58-case edge-case sweep and a replay of a real 22Rv1 DIA run)

- Inputs that used to finish as `state: ok` with nothing to show now say what's
  wrong: no measured values at all (`NO_QUANTITIES`), a single sample
  (`ONE_SAMPLE`), every sample left out or filtered away (`NOTHING_LEFT`), and
  an isoDTB ratio test with one replicate (`SMALL_GROUP` now applies to every
  method).
- An isoDTB table without probe-labelled peptides or ratio columns is reported
  as a data problem (`UNUSABLE_TABLE`, naming the probe mass) instead of "the
  read step crashed".
- A few non-numeric cells in a DIA-NN run column no longer drop the whole run
  when there's no manifest; they count as missing, with a note.
- One invalid analysis setting (e.g. `min_valid: 1`) no longer throws away
  every other setting for the run; only that key falls back to its default, and
  the note names it. `config.yaml` / `experiment.yaml` validation stays strict.

### Added

- Added an `.obvious` onboarding contract — agent guidance (`.obvious/obvious.md`),
  codebase map, repo config, and a local-dev skill — generated from a verified
  dev stack (ruff clean, 350 passed / 23 skipped, testbed end-to-end with the
  fake FragPipe). (#1)
- `runners/isodtb.py`: the isoDTB site-merge runner entry, a thin adapter over
  the existing port in `downstream/isodtb.py`, with golden tests. (#9)
- jsdom test harness for the report front end, run in CI on both OSes. (#8)
- `docs/FIRST_REAL_RUN.md`: the runbook for the first real FragPipe run on the
  PC (isoDTB, then DIA). (#31)

### Changed

- Dev installs now pin `pip>=26.2` (`deploy/dev_install.ps1` and the `dev`
  extra). (#3)
- CI tests Python 3.14 (what the lab PC runs) and 3.12 (the exe build) on
  Windows, and 3.14 and 3.11 (the floor) on Linux; previously only 3.12. The
  test job has a 15-minute timeout. (#21)
- Agents no longer merge their own PRs: the automerge workflow (#10, #11) is
  removed, `.obvious/config.yml` requires a human merge, and `.github/CODEOWNERS`
  requests owner review on every PR (D31).
- Naming: replicate and fraction tails are bounded to 1–999, and a digit run
  longer than three is never read as one, so a date-shaped tail can't become a
  replicate or fraction. (#32, #41)
- Naming: the six-digit `MMDDYY` date only matches when its year is within the
  last 25 years through next year, so run IDs like `113056` aren't read as
  dates. (#35, #41)

### Fixed

- Intake hash-verifies cross-volume copies (per-file SHA-256 over source and
  destination) before deleting the source, so a same-size corrupted copy can no
  longer silently destroy the original experiment. (#2)
- Post-move intake failures now file a minimal queued record at the destination:
  the folder is already moved, so the reconciliation sweeps re-adopt it as a job
  instead of the experiment being silently lost from all tracking. (#4)
- Cross-volume source cleanup retries transient Windows locks
  (antivirus/indexer) with bounded backoff; a lock that survives the retries
  writes a truthful `.REJECTED.txt` at the source — the filed copy is complete
  and verified, so keep it and delete the partial inbox folder — instead of the
  partial folder being re-offered and filed as an incomplete experiment. (#4)
- Desktop-shortcut creation passes the PowerShell command as base64
  `-EncodedCommand` (UTF-16LE), so install paths containing apostrophes no
  longer break shortcut creation. (#3)
- `experiment.yaml` override path fields (`user:`, `files.*.experiment:`) are
  validated before any path join: path-like values are refused (surfaced as the
  existing inbox `.REJECTED.txt` note) instead of being able to file data
  outside `users_root`. (#5)
- Installer execution requires a verified SHA-256 digest for the exact version:
  digest-less releases are never downloaded or installed, and a Downloads-found
  installer is verified against the release whose version it claims before it
  is run. (#6)
- A cross-volume copy that fails hash verification now removes its own partial
  destination (the source is untouched), so re-filing isn't wedged by
  "destination already exists"; if removal fails, the rejection names the
  leftover. (#34) The same cleanup now runs when the copy itself dies
  partway (disk full, a locked file), which used to leave a half-copy that
  got the retry rejected as "destination already exists".
- Drops with `.raw` files both at the top level and in `raw/` are rejected
  instead of silently filing a manifest of only one set; the app's Inbox view
  and naming window show the reason instead of a Tk traceback. (#36, #42)
- A raw file that vanishes (or can't be read) while a search is being prepared
  fails the job with a clear reason instead of leaving it queued forever. (#39)
- A cancel delivered while a search is starting is no longer discarded. (#38)
- FragPipe steps that die with a negative exit code (killed by a signal) are
  flagged as failed. (#27)
- A job missing from the ledger when its attempt starts fails visibly
  (`LedgerError`) instead of crashing the worker; ledger rebuild/adoption log
  every status file they skip. (#37)
- Tests: Windows CI hangs in the Tk dialog tests fixed (deterministic dialog
  drive, leak-proof teardown, bounded Tk root retry); edge-behavior tests
  pinned for ledger, watcher, worker, postprocess. (#12, #23, #25, #26, #28,
  #29, #30, #33, #40, #43)
- Tests: the two "raw vanishes during prepare" worker tests no longer depend on
  how `Path.is_file()` is implemented, so they pass on Python 3.14 as well as
  CI's 3.12. A testbed test that faked Windows by patching `os.name` globally
  crashed the whole suite on Python 3.11; it now stubs the module instead.
